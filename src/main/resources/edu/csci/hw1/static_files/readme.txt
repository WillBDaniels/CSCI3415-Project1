Hello User!
    This tutorial will help you use this Simple Java Calculator to solve mathematical expressions
one at a time or multiple at once.

====================================================================================================
If you would like the Simple Java Calculator to solve mathematical expressions one at a time:

You may use the interactive GUI and enter expression by using your mouse 
to click the onscreen buttons or you may enter the commands using your keyboard.

Example:
To solve 3+3, click the following buttons or type them from your keyboard:
[3] [+] [3] [=]

====================================================================================================
If you would like the Simple Java Calculator to solve multiple mathematical expressions at once.

1. Enter all expressions you would like solved into a text file using any basic text editor 
(Windows Notepad, Notepad++, Mousepad, Gedit, etc). Separate the expressions by a newline character
(IE: Pressing the enter key). Do not enter the = character in the expressions.

2. Now using the GUI, click Edit -> Load File

3. Choose the text file you created earlier.

Simple Java Calculator will evaluate all expressions and save the results into a new file 
called (input_name)outputFile.txt

Example:
input file: data.txt
3+3
2*3-(8-7)+24*1
2+9000-1000*3-0

output file: dataoutputFile.txt
Result of line 1 :6.0
Result of line 2 :29.0
Result of line 3 :6002.0
